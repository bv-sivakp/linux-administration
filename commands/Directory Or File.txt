List directories

~ - Home folder
$ls or dir => list directories
$ls -a  => to list all directories including hidden
$ll => lists all folders including hidden
$ls -al => with permissons
$pwd => present working directory
$ls ~ | wc -l - taking the output from one command (referred to as standard output or STDOUT) 
                and feeding it directly in as the input to another command (standard input or STDIN).
ls -lrt will give a long listing, oldest first, which is handy for seeing which files in a large directory have recently been changed.

Change Directory 

$cd / =>  Navigate to root
$cd ..  or  cd ../../ => Go back one directory or further
$cd ~/Desktop  => change directory starting from my home directory
$cd /Desktop => change directory with absolute path
$cd /tmp/  => navigate to the temp directory
$cd ~ => navigate to the home directory
 

Directory and files

$mkdir /tmp/tutorial => To create a directory
$mkdir dir3 dir4 => To Create directories in same path
$mkdir -p dir4/dir5 => To Create Strucutured directory path , here p refers create parent directory too
$ls > output.txt => print to console to file
$less combined.txt => To Read page wide text
$mv or cp => move or copy
$mv backup_combined.txt combined_backup.txt => change file name

Remove Operations
$rm out.txt => remove files
$rmdir dir5 => remove folders (removes folder if there are no files in it)
$rm -r dir2 => you want to delete a whole directory and anything within it
$rm -rf dir2 => you want to delete a whole directory and anything within it with force

File Commands

$touch file1.txt  => To create a file
$touch file1.txt file2.txt => To create multiple files
$cat - To print the file content in the standard output
$cat -v <filename.sh> # returns file with carriage returns
$grep - Used for searching data
$sed - To replace the content of the file
example:
sed -i "s/#ENV-NAME#/$DeployTarget/g" manifest.json (To update ENV_NAME globally and update the file)

To copy files from local to linux machine
scp file.txt user@ipaddress:<path>/.

To remove new line characters from a file
tr '\n' ' ' < file.csv > newfile.csv && mv newfile.csv file.csv

To remove empty lines from a file ( https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/using-sed-to-delete-empty-lines/ )
sed '/^$/d' <input-file>
echo "LINE" | sed '/^$/d'
echo "$VAR" | sed '/^$/d'
sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' input_file

File descriptor (Unique identification of file)

Three common descriptiors defined by POSIX(POSIX stands for Portable Operating System Interface, and is an IEEE standard designed to facilitate application portability) API.

0 - Standard Input
1 - Standard Ouput
2 - Standard Error

Redirect standard output (file handle 1) to /dev/null  ( /dev/null - Data will be discarded)
1>/dev/null

Redirect standard error (file handle 2) to standard output 
2>&1

1>/dev/null 2>&1  ( & symbol for file descriptor and without end 1 would be considered as a filename)
1>/dev/null 2>&1 means, that every Standard Error will be forwarded to the Standard Output and this will be also forwarded to a black hole where all information is lost.
